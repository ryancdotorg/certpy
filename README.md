# CertPy

CertPy is a high level toolkit for generating x509 (e.g. SSL/TLS/HTTPS)
certificates in Python. Certificate “profiles” are implemented as Python
classes. The nitty-gritty low level stuff is handled by the Python
Cryptographic Authority’s excellent [`cryptography`](https://cryptography.io)
package.
